## Co-Virtual Switch (CVSW) for SDN-enabled virtual networks


### Overview

CVSW is a vNIC driver designed for offloading packet processing of 
high functional virtual switches. CVSW enables per-VM packet processing, 
which reduces the load and simplifies the flow table of the virtual 
switch. CVSW's functionality can be managed by OpenFlow controllers or 
command-line shells. Here, supported functions are listed as follows:

* Para-virtualized network driver (virtio-net)
* OpenFlow 1.0 Match-Action
* MTU size setting
* Offload  setting
* VXLAN, NVGRE, STT, and Geneve tunneling (cvsw-nvo3 branch)


=
### Branches

* cvsw-nvo3       : Supports VXLAN, NVGRE, STT, and Geneve tunnels
